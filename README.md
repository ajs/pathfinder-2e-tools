# A Pathfinder 2e Tools Repository

As I find that I need tools for my Pathfinder 2e games (as a GM or player),
I will throw them here for people to play with, modify and enjoy!

## Installation

These tools use Python, so just use pip to set them up:

    pip install -e .

## `encounter`

The `encounter` tool is a random encounter generator that takes the monster list, randomizes it and then selects an encounter according to a threat level and average party level that you provide.

Use:

	$ pf2e-encounter --help

for more information.
